# Hello Kafka!

This repository is intended to be run during a workshop about Kafka.

# Setup

This project is set up with each step that will become a bit more difficult than the last.  
Each section has its own addition to this README.md file. Each step can be found in a separate branch. You can run the command `git branch -r` to find out all the steps that exist.

To check out a separate step you can issue the following command:

```shell
git checkout <branch name>
```

After such a command the new branch is visible.

If you become lost and want to reset to the beginning you can always use `git reset --hard`
